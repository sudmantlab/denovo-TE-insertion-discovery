# denovo-TE-insertion-discovery
Pipeline to identify de novo TE insertions from PacBio long-read data

# Getting started

To download the pipeline: 
``` git clone ```

Then,
``` cd denovo-TE-insertion-discovery ```

This directory has the following structure:
```

## Downloading necessary packages that cannot be installed with snakemake


## Preparing configs and inputs  

You can leave ```snakemake/config.yaml``` as is, but you'll need to generate dataset-specific template_config.yml and template_samples.tsv before running the pipeline.

For each dataset you plan on analyzing with the pipeline, you'll need to generate a new working directory (this directory can be anywhere). Then specify the full path to this directory in the your pipeline config file (e.g. template_config.yml). In this working directory, you also need to make a directory named ```data```. This directory will how the input data for the pipeline with following structure: ```data/{specimen}/{lane}/{smrtcell}.fastq.gz```. These wildcard (speciment, lane, smrtcell) need to be specified in the sample tsv file (e.g. template_samples.tsv). The columns in this file provide each of these wildcards:

| specimen | group | lane | smrtcell | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

In the config file you'll need to edit ```workdir```, ```sample_table```, ```my_tmp_path```, ```SURVIVOR_path```, ```reference```, and ```custom_lib```.

* workdir: full path to working directory
* sample_table: full path to the sample table
* my_tmp_path: full path to a directory where there is a ton of space that is accessible to compute nodes
* SURVIVOR_path: full path to directory with the survivor executable
* reference: full path to the reference assembly for your species
* custom_lib: full path to a lineage-specific curated TE library for your species
